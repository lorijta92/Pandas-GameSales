#### Goal:
Analyze purchasing data of a fantasy game. Evaluate player demographics and purchasing patterns using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.

#### Process:
There were several individual steps to this analysis which are noted in the notebook itself. However, this analysis is broken up into three major parts: gender, age, and sales.

Before diving into the subsections, I first took an overview of the data, finding the total number of players who made purchases in the game. I then performed basic calculations to find the total number of unique items, average purchase price, total number of purchases, and total revenue before storing all of that information into a data frame.
